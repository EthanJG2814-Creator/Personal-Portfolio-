## About the Site

The portfolio is a simple, responsive single‑page website with clear navigation so recruiters and collaborators can quickly understand who I am and what I’ve worked on.

Main sections:

- **Home** – Eye‑catching hero section with a photo, short tagline, and quick links to projects and resume.
- **About** – Brief overview of my biomedical engineering interests and skills.
- **Projects** – Split into *School Projects* and *Personal Projects*, highlighting design, prototyping, and research work.
- **Work Experience** – Summary of internships, research positions, and other relevant roles.
- **Contact** – Business‑card style section with email, location, and links (GitHub, LinkedIn).

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** (flexbox / grid) for responsive layout and styling

The site is deployed using **GitHub Pages** from the `main` branch.
